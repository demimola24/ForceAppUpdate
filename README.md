# ForceAppUpdate
Firebase Remote Config is a cloud service that lets you change the behavior and appearance of your app without requiring users to download an app update. When using Remote Config, you create in-app default values that control the behavior and appearance of your app. A typical example is changing the app background remotely as done in this example.

Just as well, firebase remote config can also be used to show or enforce user app updates as well as make other remote changes on the app i.e. change promo code, freebies activation, etc


The app shows a simple way to either inform a user of a pending app update or to enforce the update by making sure the user can do nothing but update the app especially if the user hasnt updated it in awhile or the outdated version is broken.
